# BeBetter-client

BeBetter is a mobile habit tracker application with social elements and reward system.

Users can create challenges (habits) and track progress in completing that challenges. Many users can join one challenge and have a conversation in the form of comments. For completing goals users are rewarded with ranking points and achievements, which are visible on userâ€™s profile page.

Project is still under development - additional funcionalities will be added and refactoring will be done.

## Architecture

Project was created in client-server architecture. 

The main purpose of the server application ([BeBetter-server](https://github.com/ozarychta/BeBetter-server)) is to implement application logic, save and read data from a global database and to share it with mobile application with REST API.

BeBetter-client is an Android mobile application that consumes the API and serves as a graphical user interface for the application.
